  type as `added` instead of `null`.

## 1.0.0

No functional changes in this version, it is published to replace obsolete 0.0.1 version on
the Pub's package homepage to improve discoverability.

Ongoing work will continue in 1.0.0-dev.* branch until it's considered stable and feature complete.
Make sure to checkout recent dev version for latest updates.

Non-breaking changes may be published to the stable track periodically.

Other updates:

- Brought back dependency on `quiver_hashcode` (2.0.0) and removed copy-pasted implementation.

## 1.0.0-dev.24.0

- Added `Firestore.getCollections`.
- Added `DocumentReference.getCollections`.
- Added `CollectionReference.id` and `CollectionReference.path`.

## 1.0.0-dev.23.0

- Fixed Firestore queries with `GeoPoint` and `Blob` arguments.

## 1.0.0-dev.22.0

- Fixed Firestore queries with `Timestamp`s. (#35)

## 1.0.0-dev.21.0

- Upgraded to latest node_interop and fixed declaration of `FirebaseError` class.

## 1.0.0-dev.20.0

This version introduces several fixes and breaking changes related to Firestore Timestamps.
It also should be compatible with latest build_runner (1.0.0) and build_node_compilers (0.2.0).

Users are encouraged to start migrating to use Firestore Timestamps instead of DateTime objects
as soon as possible. Read "Firestore Timestamps migration" in README.md for more details.

- Added: Firestore DocumentReference.parent (#30).
- Added: Firestore `Timestamp` type.
- Added: `FirestoreSettings` type and `Firestore.settings()` method which allows to control
    `timestampsInSnapshots` option for migration to new timestamps.
- Breaking: DocumentSnapshot.createTime and DocumentSnapshot.updateTime now return an instance of new
    `Timestamp` type.
- Deprecated: `DocumentData.setDateTime` and `DocumentData.getDateTime` are deprecated in favor of
    `setTimestamp` and `getTimestamp` accordingly.

## 1.0.0-dev.19.0

- Temporarily removed dependency and copied hash functions from quiver_hashcode until it supports
  Dart 2 stable.

## 1.0.0-dev.18.0

- Fixed: analysis warnings with latest Pub and Dart SDK, prepare for Dart 2 stable.

## 1.0.0-dev.17.0

- Added: complex types support to Firestore lists
- Breaking: removed generic type argument from `DocumentData.setList`
  and `DocumentData.getList` methods. Firestore does not enforce single
  type to all elements in a list, so having generic type on those
  methods was limiting.

## 1.0.0-dev.16.0

- Fixed: strong mode errors with latest Dart 2 SDK (dev.68).

## 1.0.0-dev.15.0

- Added: `Firestore.runTransaction`
- Breaking: Firestore `DocumentSnapshot.updateTime` type changed to
    `String` from `DateTime`. This field contains ISO formatted datetime
    string with nanosecond precision and can't be converted to Dart's
    `DateTime` object without loosing information (`DateTime` only
    stores microseconds). This value should be treated as opaque when
    passed to any transaction as a precondition.
- Fixed: dartdevc build by upgrading to latest build_runner.

## 1.0.0-dev.14.0

- Fixed: Firestore, fixed error calling `CollectionReference.document()`
    without arguments.
- Fixed: Firestore, fixed error calling `DocumentQuery.where()` with
    `DocumentReference` as value.

## 1.0.0-dev.13.0

- Added: Firestore, support for `SetOptions` and `WriteBatch` (#14).

## 1.0.0-dev.12.0

- Added: Firestore, support for Blob fields (#13).

## 1.0.0-dev.11.0

- Fixed: Firestore, QuerySnapshot.documentChanges was wrongly testing for
    isEmpty (#11).

## 1.0.0-dev.10.0

- Added: Firestore, support for `select`, `offset`, `startAt`,
    `startAfter`, `endAt`, `endBefore`, `FieldValue.delete` and
    `FieldValue.timestamp` (#8).
- Deprecated: Firestore, deprecated `createGeoPoint` and `createFieldPath`
    functions. These will be hidden from public API before stable
    `1.0.0` release.
- Added: Firestore, `Firestore.documentId()` function as a
    replacement for the library-level `documentId()` function.
    The library-level function is now deprecated and will be removed
    before stable `1.0.0` release.

## 1.0.0-dev.9.0

- Upgraded to JS sdk v5.11.0
- `FirebaseAdmin.initializeApp` can now be invoked without explicit
  credentials, in which case the app will be initialized with Google
  Application Default Credentials (introduced in JS SDK v5.9.1).

## 1.0.0-dev.8.0

- Fixed: GeoPoint treated as invalid type when used in Firebase Functions.

## 1.0.0-dev.7.0

  `isEqual`, `limitToFirst`, `limitToLast`, `orderByChild`, `orderByKey`,
  `orderByPriority`, `orderByValue`, `startAt`, `toJson`, `toString`.
- Added: Firebase Database `Reference.update` method.

## 1.0.0-dev.5.0

  for more details.

## 1.0.0-dev.4.0

- Breaking change: `CollectionReference.add` now expects instance of
  `DocumentData` instead of regular Dart `Map`. Use `DocumentData.fromMap` to
  upgrade from previous version.
- Fixed: Handle nested maps in `DocumentData.fromMap`.

## 1.0.0-dev.3.0

- Added: Firestore `DocumentData.keys` and `DocumentData.toMap()`.

## 1.0.0-dev.2.0

- Fixed: `DocumentQuery.snapshots` was subscribing to a wrong stream of updates.
- Added: `DocumentQuery.get`.

## 1.0.0-dev.1.0

- Breaking change: Depends on Dart SDK >= 2.0.0-dev.
- Breaking change: Depends on node_interop >= 1.0.0-dev.
